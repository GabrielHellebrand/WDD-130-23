        <p> Here's some reviews from some of the people who have explored the wonders of Rexburg's River Rafting.<p>
        <p> River Rafting is very fun, when I was on the water it felt like I was back home in Florida except for 
        less gators to ruin your trip and bless your thanksgiving. 
        I wish Lenny could've been there, he did professional gator tossing until he lost his arms in a motorcycle 
        accident, thanks Obama. Anyways, I gotta get off the computer because another gator got in the house and I need to
        find the shoval, thanks for listening. - Bahama Stan The Florida Man <p>
                    
        <p> Water is of the Devil - Jedidiah Stone <p>

        <p>I'm a dad with a daughter of datin' age. Every time my daughter brings home a bo', I take him out to this 
        here river. On the water, I speculate how deep the river is and wonder if anyone searches for the 
        bodies at the bottom. It's a little father bonding with his daughter's boyfriend time, 
        he gets the message, that was until my daughter got pregnant, 0 out of 5, don't recommend. 
        - Steve Gunderson <p>
                    
        <p> I don't river raft anymore after I learned that the water makes the frogs gay. - Ron Jones<p>
                    
        <p> My family had a great river rafting trip, the staff was friendly, polite and my wife and twelve kids had fun, 
        although we needed a bigger boat. - Nephi McConkie<p>

            <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; 
                it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and 
                relax amongst all the beauty of the great outdoors.</p>
